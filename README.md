# **DELI RESTAURANT EVENT VIEWER AND BOOKING SYSTEM**


# INTRODUCTION
The Deli Restaurant Event Viewer & Booking System was created for users to be able to see upcoming events, and for the owner to be able to manage and respond to booking requests.

Any events displayed on the site's homepage have been created by the owner of the site, and users who create an account are able to comment on these events. However, any comments displayed would have to be authorised by staff in order to minimise any instances of abuse, inappropriate language, etc.

The site is very simple at the moment, but there are a number of features which will be implemented at a later date. These have been documented in the User Stories.

To view the site please follow the link below:

# OBJECTIVES
The site's aim is to enable visitors to see all the upcoming events at the Deli Restaurant, as well as to submit booking requests.

[Back to top](#contents)

## SITE OWNER GOALS
As the site owner, the main goal of the site is to be able to list events which will be occurring at the venue, filter and review comments submitted on event posts, and manage the booking requests users submit. 

The About section on the bookings page is also editable, and the code ensures that only the latest version of this content is presented to the user.

## VISITOR GOALS

### FIRST TIME VISITORS
First time visitors to the site will see a number of events displayed on the website which have been created by the Admin.

First time users will also see a navbar with a link to the bookings page, and they are able to create an account so they can make bookings and leave comments.

### RETURNING VISITORS
Visitors returning to the site will be able to log into their personal account so they can read other users' comments which have been approved by a member of staff, view the status of their own comments, as well as edit or delete these. Once logged in, they will also be able to submit a booking request, which when approved will be shown on the Bookings page.

## WIREFRAMES
The initial wireframes for the site were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). 

The site didn't end up looking quite like the wireframes were set up, however they still helped visualise a basic layout for the website.

### SITE STRUCTURE
The structure of the site is very simple. 

It is split into three main parts:

1. [Events](#all-upcoming-events)
2. [Bookings](#bookings)
3. [Admin Site](#admin-site)

## DESIGN CHOICES
The colour scheme used in the design was inspired by the colours of Restaurante Deli, and the [coolors website](https://coolors.co/) was used to create the palette below.
